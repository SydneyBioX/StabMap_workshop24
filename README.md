# StabMap workshop

This workshop assumes that there exists a folder named `data` immediately 
above this repository folder. Within the `data` folder there should be two 
main data files: scFFPE_raw.h5ad and xenium_rep1.h5ad. These can be 
downloaded from the following links: 
https://www.huber.embl.de/users/harald/embo/scFFPE_raw.h5ad
https://www.huber.embl.de/users/harald/embo/xenium_rep1.h5ad

With thanks to Harald Vohringer for preparing the processed data objects.
